# AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

## Overview

This project is part of the AirBnB clone and focuses on building a command interpreter in Python. The command interpreter allows the management of AirBnB objects, including creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations on objects, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

## Project Details

- **Start Date:** February 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** February 12, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** February 10, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Manual QA Review:** To be done upon completion of the project
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Concepts

In this project, you will delve into the following concepts:

- Python packages
- AirBnB clone
- Command-line interface
- Unit testing
- Serialization and deserialization of objects
- File storage

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to understand:

- How to create a Python package
- Implementation of a command interpreter using the cmd module
- Unit testing in a large project
- Serialization and deserialization of a class
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Handling datetime in Python
- Working with UUID
- Usage of *args and **kwargs
- Managing named arguments in a function

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files end with a new line
- First line of all files is `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- README.md file is mandatory
- Code adheres to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files are executable
- Length of files will be tested using wc
- Modules, classes, and functions have documentation

### Python Unit Tests

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files end with a new line
- Test files are inside a folder named `tests`
- unittest module is used
- Test files are Python files (extension: .py)
- Test files and folders start with `test_`
- File organization in the `tests` folder mirrors the project structure
- Tests are executed using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`

## Usage

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

Python3 -m unittest discover tests
